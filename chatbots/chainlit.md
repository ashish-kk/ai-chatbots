# Red Hat RAG Demo ChatBot

This ChatBot uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to add knowledge about Red Hat's OpenShift AI and it's predessor Red Hat OpenShift Data Science (RH ODS) product.
Feel free to chat with it and learn about the product and see a RAG system working in parallel with an LLM which has no knowledge of its own about either product.

## Notes
